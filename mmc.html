<div class="title"> SHOE COMPANY</div>

<div class="narrative"> The Travelancer boot is an imagined shoe that came from 
    a shoe company that I created named “The MMC Shoe Company”.  I created the 
    shoe brand as a reflection of my own personal identity and designed the logos,
     packaging, and company advertisements. Along with the visuals, I also created 
     a “unique selling proposition”. I chose to create a brand surrounding an outdoor
      travel boot that is versatile and comfortable and could transition between 
      different environments.  The shoe represented freedom and comfort, and a respect 
      for the outdoors.  I also chose to make the shoe sustainable, and created a program 
      ithin the brand that repairs and recycles shoes to reduce waste.  The identity 
      of the brand was inspired by the ways I like to live my own life.  My designs were
       inspired by this brand identity.  I kept the color palette to earth tones and 
       created a name, “Travelancer Boot,”  that I felt embodied the sense of freedom 
       that I was trying to capture.  The entirety of the brand consisted of a company 
       name and shoe name along with logos for each, a design for the shoe box, an insert 
       to go into the shoebox, and an ad campaign of three different advertisements.  
       All of these aspects worked together to create a holistic brand and design package
        that would resonate with people who strive to live a simple and sustainable
         lifestyle of exploring the earth and all it has to offer.  </div>
