 <div class="title"> HOTEL & RESTAURANT <br> BRAND </div>

 <div class="narrative"> Hotel de Serenite and Cafe Lavan are an imaged hotel
      and restaurant brand located in the South of France.  I created branding 
      for the hotel and cafe taking inspiration from a planned trip to study abroad 
      in Paris that was cancelled due to Covid-19.  I aimed to create a peaceful
       and serene hotel in Provence, France that was a place of rest and relaxation.
         The Cafe, doubling as a bookstore, that accompanied the hotel was also intended 
         to have this same atmosphere of calmness.  I came up with names, created logos,
          different hotel and cafe product labels, and a menu for the cafe that all
           feature designs that were inspired by the intended atmosphere of the two 
           establishments as well as imagery from the region such as lavender and 
           prominent buildings.  The logos and branding items all came together and 
           formed a holistic brand for both the hotel and cafe. </div>
