<div class= "title"> VINTAGE BOOK <br> REDESIGN </div>

<div class="narrative"> “Perception” is a redesign of the book cover of a vintage
     psychology book that was published in 1968.  The purpose of this redesign was
      to refresh the book cover with a more modern style of imagery.  I chose to
       make the title of the book the main feature of the design and add in 
       representations of eyes, changing the color of the text that is seen through 
       the eyes.  This was done in order to represent the shift in perspective that 
       happens when looking at things through other peoples’ eyes.  The colors are 
       complimentary orange and blue in order to make them pop off of the page.  The 
       final design was then put into a Photoshop mock-up featuring the cover and spine
        of the book to emulate what the design would look like on an actual book. </div>
