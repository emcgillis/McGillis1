    <div class="narrative">This Travel and Leisure cover was an imagined cover and 
        editorial spread for the magazine “Travel and Leisure”.  I selected Yellowstone
         National Park as my destination that the cover and featured article would focus
          on as that is somewhere that I would love to explore someday and I wanted to 
          highlight the beauty of the park and my own appreciation for the outdoors. 
           The project features a cover and two spreads that contain an article about
            Yellowstone that was found online.  All images used in the work are sourced 
            from Unsplash.  Creating this spread allowed me to learn how to utilize Adobe
            InDesign to grasp the technical requirements involved in forming a successful 
            magazine spread.  </div>
